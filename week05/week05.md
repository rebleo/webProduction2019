##### Pair Programming Project
Ideate + come up with a concept. Choose a theme or subject such as interiors or sad animated gifs...

Create two different layouts using CSS Grid. It may be two separate web pages or both layouts in one page or even a grid nested in a grid. It also must include 1 flexbox, feed back for the user (relative links, hover changes, etc).

Include text, image and/or video in each page. The layout themselves are entirely up to you - the goal is to use css grid + flex in different formats + learn from one another.

Today: create a wireframe to present your idea + design strategy to the class. Start building your site.

For Monday: Get your site running on each of yr servers. Do NOT post yr project site to the class wiki. Be prepared to present your finished sites during critique in class on Monday.
